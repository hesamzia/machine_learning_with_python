# machine_learning_with_python

In this repository, we try to solve some projects in the field of machine learning methods such as regression, classification, and clustering, and ultimately arrive at good models that can predict new things. We use python and it's tools that run in Jupyter notebook. 

## Regression
For this project, after viewing the previous data (data on approximately 4000 apartments in a city) and its results, I found so many bugs in the old data that I felt I needed better data to test better. So, after finding new data, I moved the old data and all the work we had done in the notebook to the folder back and decided to start from scratch with the new data. We will continue with the new data and hope to see the desired training results.
we used the King County Housing Dataset from Kaggle that includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015, features 21 columns, and over 21,000 entries Ø´nd it is saved in a cvs file in the data folder called kc_house_data.cvs.
The data has integer and float data types, some of which probably need to be changed. Also, at first glance, three columns are missing data, which need to be further examined and managed. The columns of data invludes :
- id : Unique identifier for a house
- date : Date house was sold (2014,2015)
- price : Sale price (prediction target)
- bedrooms : Number of bedrooms
- bathrooms : Number of bathrooms
- sqft_living : Square footage of living space in the home
- sqft_lot : Square footage of the lot
- floors : Number of floors (levels) in house
- waterfront : Whether the house is on a waterfront
- view : Quality of view from house
- condition : How good the overall condition of the house is. Related to maintenance of house. See the King County      Assessor Website for further explanation of each condition code
- grade : Overall grade of the house. Related to the construction and design of the house. See the King County Assessor Website for further explanation of each building grade code
- sqft_above : Square footage of house apart from basement
- sqft_basement : Square footage of the basement
- yr_built : Year when house was built
- yr_renovated : Year when house was renovated
- zipcode : ZIP Code used by the United States Postal Service
- lat : Latitude coordinate
- long : Longitude coordinate
- sqft_living15 : The square footage of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors
- sqft_lot15 : The square footage of the land lots of the nearest 15 neighbors
